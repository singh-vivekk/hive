''' ---------- Subqueries concepts --------- '''
Hive supports subqueries in FROM clauses and in WHERE clauses of SQL statements.
A subquery is a SQL expression that is evaluated and returns a result set.
Then that result set is used to evaluate the parent query.
The parent query is the outer query that contains the child subquery.
Subqueries in WHERE clauses are supported in Hive 0.13 and later.
The following example shows a subquery inserted into a WHERE clause:

    SELECT state, net_payments
        FROM transfer_payments
            WHERE transfer_payments.year IN (SELECT year FROM us_census);

No configuration is required to enable execution of subqueries in Hive.
The feature is available by default.
However, several restrictions exist for the use of subqueries in WHERE clauses.
Subqueries in WHERE clauses are supported in Hive 0.13 and later.
