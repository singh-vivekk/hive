We have 3 types of functions in Hive:
1. Standard functions: round(), floor(), abs(), reverse(), concat(), ucase()

2. Aggregate functions: Sum(), Avg(), Min(), Max()

3. Table generating functions: explode(), Array()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of UDF:
1. Regular UDF: Operate on a single row and produces a single row as its output
2. User Defined Aggregate functions: Works on multiple input row and creates a single output row
3. User Defined Table generating functions: Operates on a single row and produces multiple row (a table) as output

Conditions of UDF:
1. A UDF must be a subclass of org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.UDF
2. A UDF must implement at least one evaluate method. Its not just a override, we can overload as well
